# Naloxsafe Mobile
React Native Application

Naloxsafe Mobile is a project currenty in development for the University of Victoria's Student Services Department.

# Motivation
“Young Canadians aged 15 to 24 are the fastest-growing population requiring hospital care from the opioid overdoses.” - Government of Canada Stat. 

“The majority of people lived and overdosed in private residences.” - British Columbia's Ministry of Public Safety Solicitor General. 

Drug overdoses/poisenings can occur at any moment. We hope to provide an accesssible tool as an alternative to in person overdose training.

# Problem 
1. There aren't enough people who can recognise/diagnose a drug overdose
2. There aren't enough people who know what to do if an overdose occurs 
3. It takes too long for emergency services/trained personnel to arrive to the scene of an overdose in areas where they are uncommon

# Solution Concept
1. Naloxsafe Mobile provides the user with the ability to quickly and accurately diagnose and treat a drug overdose through step by step instruction.
2. Naloxsafe Mobile will reduce the chance of user error and time taken when administering emergency medication such as naloxone or narcan during an overdose through very clear instruction. 
3. Naloxsafe Mobile provides users with a method to quickly connect with other Noloxsafe trained personnel and emergency services to receive aid as fast as possible.
